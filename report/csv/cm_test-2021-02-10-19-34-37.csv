chaining to a trusted full boot loader under secure boot environments.

The fwupdate packages provide a service that allows session software to
update device firmware.

  * grub2: grub_malloc does not validate allocation size allowing for
arithmetic overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer overflow
(CVE-2020-14308)

  * grub2: Integer overflow in grub_squash_read_symlink may lead to
heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-14309)

  * grub2: Integer overflow read_section_as_string may lead to heap-based
