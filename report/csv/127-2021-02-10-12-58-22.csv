  NOTE: No severity for SMTP services with 'Opportunistic TLS' and weak cipher suites on port 25/tcp is reported.
  If too strong cipher suites are configured for this service the alternative would be to fall back to an even more insecure
  cleartext communication.","'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.2 protocol:

  that it does not accept the listed weak cipher suites anymore.

  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.","","These rules are applied for the evaluation of the cryptographic strength:

  - RC4 is considered to be weak (CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808).

  - Ciphers using 64 bit or less are considered to be vulnerable to brute force methods
  and therefore considered as weak (CVE-2015-4000).

  - 1024 bit RSA authentication is considered to be insecure and therefore as weak.

  - Any cipher considered to be secure for only the next 10 years is considered as medium

  - Any other cipher is considered as strong","
